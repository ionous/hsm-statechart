Notes for HSM_STATE:

    The wrapper for state() lets parent and child live in different translation units (.c files)
    if all states were gauranteed to be in the same unit
    depth could be a counter enum { enum {State##Depth = Parent##Depth+`;} and data could be static.

    it might be possible to split the macro split into 'decl' and 'implement' sections
    and create the same effect, but i think not without duplicating the parameters every usage

    Additional notes for Initial State:

    The initial state uses two lookup functions to ensure a valid name when initial= 0
    and to enable link time checking that the initial state is a child of parent.

for any given macro expansion the definitions are:

    State##Lookup##Initial: forward declares, but doesn't implement.
    Parent##Lookup##State : implements this in case our parent wants us as its initial state.
    State##Lookup##0      : returns 0.

so, for two these two states:

    HSM_STATE( Outer, Top, Inner );
     HSM_State( Inner, Outer, 0 );

we get these this sequence of declarations:

     state outer:
        OuterLookupInner();                  <--- declared, defined later; this is the initial we want.
        OuterLookup0() { return 0; }         <--- unused, most linkers will optimize
        Outer() {
          initial= OuterLookupInner();       <--- if inner isn't a child of outer, linker complains
        }
        TopLookupOuter() { return Outer; }   <--- unused, most linkers will optimize

     state inner:
        InnerLookup0();                      <--- this is the initial we want
        InnerLookup0() { return 0; }         <--- and the standard implementation
        Inner() {
           initial= InnerLookup0();          <--- meaning we don't get an initial state.
        }
        OuterLookupInner() { return Inner; } <--- inneris* a child of outer, this proves it.
